Locate your alarm clock and identify the controls for setting the alarm time and alarm sound. This may involve buttons, knobs, or switches, depending on the type of alarm clock you have.\n2. Set the alarm time to 7 AM by adjusting the controls accordingly.\n3. Select Jazz music as the alarm sound. This may involve choosing a preset sound or tuning to a Jazz radio station if your alarm clock has those features.\n4. Verify that the alarm is properly set for 7 AM with Jazz music by checking the alarm time and sound settings on the clock.\n\nUsing a clock app on a smartphone or computer:\n\n1. Open the clock app on your smartphone or computer. This may be a built-in clock app or a third-party clock app that you have installed.\n2. Navigate to the alarm settings or alarm clock section of the app, which allows you to set alarms.\n3. Create a new alarm for 7 AM by selecting the \"Add New Alarm\" or similar option and setting the alarm time accordingly.\n4. Choose Jazz music as the alarm sound.
